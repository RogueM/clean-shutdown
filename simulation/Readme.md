# On-Off-Shim Simulation and Extension for Supply Voltage >5V

Two [LTspice XVII](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) setups are provided:
1. Starting from the schematic provided in https://github.com/pimoroni/clean-shutdown/issues/18#issuecomment-456816943, the original circuit was modeled.
2. The circuit was modified to use an 18V supply with an additional 5V voltage regulator. The modification is targeted to the [HifiBerry Amp2](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/boards/hifiberry-amp2/), but could be used in other cases where a supply voltage >5V needs to be switched.
